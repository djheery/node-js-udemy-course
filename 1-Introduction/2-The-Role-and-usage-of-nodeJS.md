# Understanding the Role and Usage of NodeJS 

NodeJS is used on the server side to execute commands that we otherwise would not want to do in the browser. 
For example user authentication, accessing a database, input validation and business logic. 

Doing this on the server prevents security issues and prevents clients from accessing secure code such as your authentication/ business logic. 

NodeJS is not limited to running on the Server
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime, it can be used to make Build Tools, and utility scripts. 

Generally it is used in Web Development and Server Side code. 

NodeJS will: 

- Run the Server
  - Create a Server and listen to incoming request and respond 
- Implement Business Logic
  - Handle Requests, Validate Inputs, Connect to a Database
- Responses
  - Return Responses (Rendered HTML, JSON)

NodeJS alternatives: 

- Python
- php 
- Ruby
- ASP.NET
