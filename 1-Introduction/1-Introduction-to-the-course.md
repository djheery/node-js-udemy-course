## What is Node JS?

NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime. 
General JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM after it is loaded. 

NodeJS is built on JavaScript and allows you to run JavaScript code on the Server (Not just the server, but anywhere else).

This means that we can use NodeJS to run JavaScript outside the browser. 
NodeJS utilizes the V8 engine which takes JS browser code and compiles it to machine code. 

V8 Engine is written in C++ 
V8 Adds features such as working with your local file system which allows it to work on server.
