# What is MVC

MVC is all about the separatinon of concerns 

- Model 
- Views 
- Controllers 

Models are responsible for representing and working with your data 

Views are responsible for what users see (UI)

Controllers are responsible for connecting the model and the view

Routes are used to define which model and view logic should be implemented. 

Controllers are split across middleware functions.
